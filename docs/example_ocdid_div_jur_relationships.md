Here are some examples of how jurisdictions are associated with divisions:

Jurisidiction:
    id="ocd-jurisdiction/country:us/state:wa/county:seattle_county",
Associated Divisions:
    id = "ocd-division/country:us/state:wa/county:seattle_county"
            id = "ocd-division/country:us/state:wa/county:seattle_county/cousub:1"
            id = "ocd-division/country:us/state:wa/county:seattle_county/cousub:2"

Here is another example:

    Jurisdictions:
        id="ocd-jurisdiction/country:us/state:wa/schoolboard:SeattleSchoolBoard"

            id="ocd-jurisdiction/country:us/state:wa/schoolboard:SeattleSchoolBoard/div:Franklin School District" # if it has it's own elected board.

    Associated Divisions:
