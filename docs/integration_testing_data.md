# Prompt
Create sample data for the following places, each with their own division and
jurisdiction id.  The goal is to use this data to run integration tests. So, it should be real verifiable data.

#sym:## Inputs and outputs 
## Input 
Source files contain a set of representative test records

tests/sample_data/testing_ocd_sample.csv
tests/sample_data/testing_creyton_sample.csv

## Output

### Output files
Each output should include the complete set of test records. 

1. a python file containing the Divison model
2. a python file containing the Jurisdication model 
3. a json file containing the serialized json divisions from the Division model
4. a json file containing the serialized json jurisdictions from the Jurisdiction model. 
5. a .yaml file stored in  jurisdictions/test/<state>/local for each Jurisdiction 
5. a .yaml file stored in  divisions/test/<state>/local for each Division 

### Output structure and data completeness
The structure and the data must be consisted across all output types. 
The output should include all defined values. If the true value is not available
in any of the source files: 
- first try searching the web using the known data as context
- If that also fails, use a placeholder value representing the missing data
  prefixed by "missing".  

### Output directory 
All files should be stored here. 
tests/sample_output
